# *Public* Directory for RuneLingual Transcript Sources

> :warning: **IMPORTANT:** This directory is for **final versions only**. All players using RuneLingual will download files from here. Ensure that all transcripts are error-free before adding them here. Any mistakes could lead to a poor user experience for all RuneLingual users.

Welcome to the public directory of the RuneLingual Transcript Sources. This directory holds the finalized, published versions of our transcripts.
## Guidelines for the Public Directory

Follow these steps to maintain the integrity of the public directory:

1. Make initial edits in the "draft" directory.
2. Run the code as stated in [README for updater](../updater/README.md).
3. Review the draft thoroughly. Resolve any issues. This step is critical.
4. Once the draft is error-free, copy it to this public directory.

Remember, only add final versions here. The version you add should be the latest and ready for use.
