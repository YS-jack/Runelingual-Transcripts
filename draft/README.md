# Draft Folder Contents

This section outlines the workflow and tools recommended for translators working with files in the Draft folder.

## Translation Files
- **Excel Files**: Translators should download files ending with `'.xlsx'` from each language's folder. These are the primary documents requiring translation.

## Recommended Translation Tools
- **CAT Tools**: For an easier and more efficient translation process, the use of Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools is recommended. An example of such a tool is SmartCat.

## Generating and Updating Transcripts
- For detailed instructions on generating and updating transcripts, please refer to the [updater documentation](../updater/README.md).
